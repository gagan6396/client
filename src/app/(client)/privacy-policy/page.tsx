            HOW WE USE COOKIES
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your
            computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the
            cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a
            particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as
            an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your
            needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information
            about your preferences. We use traffic log cookies to identify which
            pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about webpage
            traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer
            needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis
            purposes and then the data is removed from the system. Overall,
            cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to
            monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie
            in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about
            you, other than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose
            to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
            cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline
            cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full
            advantage of the website.
